# Viper Dash

Viper Dash is a simple console-based game implemented in C++ where the player controls a character to navigate through obstacles and collect coins.

## Overview

In Viper Dash, the player controls a character represented by the '#' symbol. The objective is to avoid obstacles represented by 'X' symbols and collect coins represented by 'o' symbols. The player's health decreases upon collision with obstacles, and the game ends when the health reaches zero. The player can move using arrow keys and jump using the space bar.

## How to Play

1. Use the arrow keys (left, right, up, down) to move the player character.
2. Press the space bar to jump over obstacles.
3. Avoid collision with 'X' symbols to maintain health.
4. Collect 'o' symbols to increase the score.
5. The game ends when the player's health reaches zero.
